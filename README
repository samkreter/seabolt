DISCLAIMER
----------
This software is pre-alpha.
I mean it's not even using the Greek alphabet yet.
Its maturity can be considered approximately Egyptian hieroglyphics.
This is "eye of Horus", "head of dog" or "man standing sideways" software.
Don't use it.
Your computer will break.
Or possibly explode.
Or implode.
Either way, it won't be good.
And I can't be held responsible.
I don't even know anything about it.
About what?
I don't know.
See? I didn't even know that.
Now go about your business.
As you were.
